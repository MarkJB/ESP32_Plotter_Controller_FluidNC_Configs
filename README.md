# ESP32_Plotter_Controller_FluidNC_Configs

Config files for the ESP32 Plotter Controller

A base config to get started with when using FluidNC and the ESP32 Plotter Controller

Note: The current config.yaml is configured for CoreXY. See the wiki http://wiki.fluidnc.com/en/config/overview for details of how to change this to something else. Currently supports standard cartesian, coreXY and Wallbot (haning v-plotter/polargraph)
